### Title: ?

### Genre: Arena fighter

### Target audience: E for everyone

## Game Concept:

You are playing as a cowboy fighting wild life and bandits but you have lost your revolver. Your main weapon is gone but you luckily have your secondary weapon: your magic rope. This rope has the magic property that whenever it forms a loop it does damage. You have two ways do do damage with this rope, You have a lasso which you can throw, the longer you hold the throw button, the further you throw it but also the smaller the radius becomes. This is your main attack which you activate with your left mouse button. Your second (more powerfull) attack is a piece of rope you have attached to your belt, which drags after you. When this rope makes a loop it does a lot of damage. Both weapons and armour can be upgraded with found or bought items.
